    DESCRIPTION OF THE DIGITAL VERSION OF THE ASTEROID PHOTOMETRIC CATALOGUE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



GENERAL

The lightcurves for each asteroid are stored in a separate file.  Examples 
of such files are enclosed.  For each lightcurve there is an information 
header of about ten lines followed by a table of data.  Each line in the
information header starts with a string (Fortran format A16) specifying
what kind of entry it contains.  The information to the right of these 
strings can be read with the formats shown in the enclosed table.  The 
entries can come in any order and most of them are not compulsory (defaults 
for entries not specified are given in the enclosed table).  The end of the 
information header and the start of the table is marked by the string 
"DATA:".  The table may contain any number of lines (including zero) and 
is followed by a line with the string "================".  This string is
followed by a new lightcurve header, or the string "END OF OBJECT" if it is 
the last lightcurve in the file. 


PHILOSOPHY

For data points digitized from the printed publication, the philosophy 
is that the numerical values in the table should correspond directly 
to those in the original lightcurve diagram from which it was digitized.  
The information header above it specifies what information was plotted 
on the abscissa and ordinate.  For data obtained digitally directly from
the observers, we try to change as little as possible in their tabular 
data, and use the information header to specify what the table contains.
   For historical reasons, the above philosophy was not followed in the 
first versions of the catalogue, so you may find inconsistencies in 
presentation style between old and more recent lightcurves.


TABLE COLUMNS 
 
A "COLUMNS" entry in the information header specifies the order and type 
of columns appearing in the table, using the following codes:
        
                     #  = time (default unit is hours)
                     @  = solar phase angle
                     ^  = distance from the Earth
                     *  = distance from the Sun
                     .  = error estimate of value in previous column
                     -  = unspecified column
   alphabetic character = a magnitude 
 
For example, the string  "#U.B.V."  specifies a table with a time column,
followed by three pairs of columns with the UBV magnitudes and their
errors. In most cases their are just two columns, e.g. "#V", i.e. a time
column and a V-magnitude column.  The table should be read in free format.  
Note that the number of decimals included have no bearing on the accuracy 
of the data values.  Any extra information may be put to the right of the 
last column.  


TIME SCALE

By default, the time column (#) show the mean Universal Time (UT) in hours
of the individual integrations.  A "UNIT OF TIME" entry in the information 
header may be used to define another time unit, e.g. 1 day.  A boolean 
variable in the "LT CORRECTED" entry shows if light time correction has 
been applied to the data.  The zero point of the above time scale is 
specified in Julian Days in the "ZERO TIME" entry.  Since this may in 
some cases be far from the actual time of observation, an "OBSERVING
TIME" entry shows approximately when the observations were carried out.


MAGNITUDE SCALE
 
The magnitude columns contain by default observed magnitudes in a standard
system (may be specified in detail in a "PHOT. SYSTEM" entry).  Boolean 
variables in the "REDUCED MAG." and "ZERO SOL PHASE" entries show if the 
tabulated values have been reduced to unit heliocentric and geocentric 
distances and if they are corrected to zero solar phase angle, respectively.  
Relative photometry is flagged in a "RELATIVE PHOT" entry.  The "UNIT OF MAG."
entry may specify magnitude or luminosity units for the table.  The number 
given in the "ZERO MAG." entry should be added to all magnitudes (some 
observers plot relative magnitudes, but supply a zero magnitude in a 
separate table).
 
 
MULTIPLE FILTER PHOTOMETRY
 
Data obtained through more than one filter on a single night may be stored
in two ways:  Firstly, each type of magnitude may be separated and have its 
own information header and table, i.e. the data points from each filter are
treated as an independent lightcurve.  Secondly, each type of magnitude may
be stored in a separate column in the same table.  This second method should
only be used when all filter integrations were obtained simultaneously
(multiple channel photometer), or were obtained in succesion in a fixed
cycle of filter wheel movements.  Since only one time column (#) is allowed,
offsets in timing for the different columns/filters may be specified in a
"TIME SHIFTS" entry (unit: seconds).  The "ZERO MAG." entry, introduced in 
the previous section, may contain one value for each magnitude column.
   Many observers do multiple filter photometry (as a check, for reduction
puposes etc.), but they publish lightcurves in a single filter only.  We 
nevertheless try to include all filter measurements if available to us.


COMPOSITES

Published lightcurves are often in the form of composites constructed by
shifting the observations some integer number of synodic rotation cycles
in time and adjusting the curves vertically in some way.  Ideally, one 
should transform these data back to the original observations, but this
inverse operation is often not well-defined in the publications.
Therefore, the composites are usually left as published, and there
nature is flagged by boolean truth in the "COMPOSITE" entry.  The "ZERO
TIME" entries of the curves from the same composite thus contain the same
value, and the "OBSERVING TIME" entries show the dates of the actual 
observations.  Note that, although the number of decimals does not reveal 
it, the zero times are usually accurate to about one minute of time, 
whereas the observing times often are rounded to the nearest date.
Usually one of the lightcurves in the composite is kept fixed, and it
may be flagged in a "FIXED" entry.  If no such entry appears, it can be 
assumed that the lightcurve with identical "ZERO TIME" and "OBSERVING TIME",
if any, was kept fixed.  There exist published composites with an unspecified 
zero point for the time-scale;  Each such composite has been given a unique 
string appearing after the boolean value in the "COMPOSITE"  entry.
If no such string appears, then composite lightcurves with the same 
"ZERO TIME" come from the same composite.  The "COMPOSITE MAG." entry 
specifies if the tabulated magnitudes are transformed to the level of 
the FIXED lightcurve.


GENERAL INFORMATION
 
The entries "REFERENCE", "OBSERVING SITE", "TELESCOPE", "DETECTOR" and 
"ACQUISITION" are mostly self-explanatory.  The two numbers appearing 
first in the "OBSERVING SITE" entry are the geographic (west) longitude 
and latitude of the telescope in decimal degrees.  An "ASPECT" entry 
contains five free format real numbers containg heliocentric and geocentric 
distances to the asteroid, solar phase angle, and ecliptic geocentric 
longitude and latitude of the asteroid (units: AU and degrees).  Information
not covered by any of the specific entries may be given in a general 
"INFORMATION" entry.


BAD DATA

Measurements that don't seem to make sense have been flagged by an 
exclaimation mark "!" as the first character on the corresponding lines 
of the table.  Data that spoil analysis have been rejected in this way, 
while keeping it simple to unmark them if future reinterpretation should 
be more in there favour.  


FEED BACK
 
The data base has evolved and we have inserted more and more specific
information when our applications demanded it.  As new observing methods
come in use and in responce to new uses of the catalogue, we expect it
to continue evolving.  Please inform us of any suggestion you may have 
on how to improve it and make it more useful to you.  I know it still 
contains many errors.  Information on errors you spot are be most appeciated.  
Obviously, lightcurves sent to us in digital form will ensure the highest 
quality and reliability in future updates of the catalogue.

The formats in parenthesis are Fortran codes.  The other entries should be read 
in free format (real*8 = double precission real).  The format "physical" look
like standard quantities with units,  e.g. "6.3745 hours" and "0.79 days", 
for units of time, and e.g. "-1.0 mag." (inverted magnitude scale) and 
"1.0 lum." (arbitrary brightness scale).
